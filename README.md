🎰 Multi-Draw Web3 Lottery Smart Contract (ink!)

This is an ink! smart contract written in Rust that implements a decentralized lottery system with support for multiple draws and multiple bets per draw.

Each draw has its own jackpot, list of bets, winners, and state (open/closed). The contract is designed for deployment on Substrate-based blockchains (such as Xode, Aleph Zero, or Astar).

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is created strictly for educational and research purposes only.  It demonstrates how to build and structure a lottery-style contract using ink! smart contracts on Substrate-based chains.

Do not use this contract in any live gambling, casino, or real-money system.  The authors and contributors are not liable for any misuse, deployment, or financial loss arising from modifying or using this code in production environments.
